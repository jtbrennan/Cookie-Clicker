# Cookie-Clicker
This app functions as the Classic Cookie Clicker Game. The app as a Custom Menu at the top of the page, and with responsive web developement converts to a hamburger style Menu on Mobile. The app has a Cookie Toggle Button which allows the user to gain cookies upon clicking. Every time the user clicks on the cookie, the user gains a point. Below the cookie and the point counter, the app has 7 powerups. Each powerups has different abilities and costs. For example the "Auto" powerup costs 450 points but gives the user an additional 3 points per second autonomously. The app uses CSS for responsiveness, jQuery for functionality, and fontAwesome for Icons.
